## Input

Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2021 Task 1 [BraTS](https://www.kaggle.com/dschettler8845/brats-2021-task1 "BRaTS 2021 Task 1 Dataset") dataset is used.

The dataset includes 3D MRI co-registered and skull-stripped scans that describe : 
- Native T1, 
- Post-contrast T1-weighted, 
- T2-weighted, 
- T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR),
- Manually annotated segmentation.
